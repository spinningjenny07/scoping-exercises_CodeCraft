			Is craneId global or local on line 23? - local
			Why is isViable not global on line 33? - because it's inside of the function isViableCrane and is still executed inside of the function.
			Put into english what makes a "viable" crane by reading through the function isViableCrane:
			When called the function isViableCrane takes the perameter of crane and executes: if the length of crane (which is 2), is greater than the height of crane (which is 1) then isViable is equal to true, or else the value of isViable is equal to false. The value of isViable is then returned.
